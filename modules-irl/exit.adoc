=== Getting out

If roadblocks are insurmountable, +
getting out is easy:

```bash
find . -name module-info.java -type f -delete
```

=== Preparations

But first:

* move documentation elsewhere
* declare services the old way
* update command line options +
  (e.g. `--add-exports` and paths)
* move from jlink to jpackage

=== Lost work

What about all the work?!

Some benefits remain:

* good while it lasted
* cleaner architecture
* documentation

=== Getting out

Not a great step, +
but at least it's possible!

‚áù Makes it feasible to experiment.
