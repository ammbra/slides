== Java Modules In Real Life

{toc}

=== Observations & Assumptions

Observations:

* modules require & enforce a decent architecture
* (re)factoring modules << (re)factoring code
* most problems originate in dependencies

Assumption:

* barring problematic dependencies, +
  modules are a net-positive

=== Those damn dependencies!

Why are dependencies so often the problem?

* almost all still baseline against JDK ≤ 8
* makes creating/maintaining modules tougher
* number of modularized apps is small +
  and thus demand is small (but growing)

[%step]
But more and more ship as modules: +
https://github.com/sormuras/modules[sormuras/modules] tracks 4128 unique modules +
(as of March 29th).

=== Project size

What impact does project size have?

Simplified:

⇝ Project size doesn't matter (much).

=== Project type

General benefits for all kinds of projects:

* managing dependencies
* preventing (accidental) use +
  of internal (JDK) APIs
* new abstraction
* etc.

=== Project type

Frameworks and libraries...

* benefit from strong encapsulation
* shouldn't limit users

Applications benefit from...

* strong encapsulation (!)
* self-contained images (possibly)

⇝ Project type has little practical impact, +
  but reused code should consider users.

=== Project age

New projects: ::
* module declarations and architecture +
  evolve side by side
* new dependencies can be vetted

Existing projects: ::
* modules must be retrofitted
* architecture may require updating +
  (which can be the goal!)
* existing dependencies must work

⇝ New projects are a better fit.

=== Domain (knowledge)

Impact of domain (knowledge) on dependencies:

* maintenance of domain-specific dependencies
* choice of domain-specific dependencies
* understanding of domain to evaluate that +
  and to analyze unexpected problems

⇝ Easier if domain isn't niche +
  and you understand it well.

=== When (not)?

Best place to start:

* new projects
* in well-understood, +
  well-maintained domain
* particularly if reused

Next best place: your current project! +
(Unless it has lots of outdated dependencies.)

=== How to

Do: ::
* Accept that partial modularization brings +
  partial benefits. Then start small.
* Use module declarations to analyze, guide, +
  document, and review architecture.

Don't: ::
* Get stuck trying to fix dependencies: +
  identify root cause, open an issue, +
  put on class path, wait for (or contribute) fix.
* Forget that modules are seat belt, not a rocket.
