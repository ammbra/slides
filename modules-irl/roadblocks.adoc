== Java Modules In Real Life

{toc}

=== Roadblocks

Before we look at specific situations:

* most problems originate in dependencies
* often stem from automatic modules
* can often be fixed by demoting them to class path

=== Automatic Culprits

Many problems come from JARs on the module path +
that aren't ready to be modules.

> Minimize number of automatic modules!

Only put on module path:

* your modular JARs
* the JARs they depend on

That deals with most transitive dependencies.

=== Automatic Culprits

If your code directly depends on +
a troublesome automatic module:

* put problematic JARs on class path
* subprojects that depend on them:
** do not modularize
** define automatic module name
** put on module path

‚áù Modularize elsewhere.

=== Roadblocks

Some common or tricky roadblocks:

* split packages
* broken module descriptors
* reflective access
* unsupported media type

=== Split packages

The module system requires each package +
to belong to exactly one module.

```bash
# compiler
error: package exists in another module: ...
	package ...;

#run time ‚Äî between two modules
Error occurred during initialization of boot layer
java.lang.reflect.LayerInstantiationException:
	Package ... in both module ... and module ...

#run time ‚Äî between module and class path
Exception in thread "main" NoClassDefFoundError: ...
	at ...
```

=== Split package solution

The (only) solution: +
Ask maintainers to...

* reorganize packages across JARs/modules, or
* provide uber JAR that contains all code

=== Split package workarounds

Workarounds exist:

* merge the modules
* create a _bridge module_
* use the unnamed module
* patch the module

=== Merging modules

Projects that don't publish artifacts +
can merge the splitting JARs:

* create a subproject that...
** depends on the splitting JARs
** merges them (e.g. shading in Maven)
** maybe contains a module descriptor
* modular code depends on that subproject

Alternatively, set the subproject up separately +
and install the JAR in your local Nexus.

=== Creating a bridge

Projects that can encapsulate their use +
of splitting JARs in one subproject, +
can make that a bridge:

* create a subproject that...
** depends on the splitting JARs
** contains all code that uses them
** becomes an automatic module +
   (i.e. no module descriptor!)
* modular code depends on that subproject
* put splitting JARs on class path

=== More workarounds

The other workarounds (not shown here):

* manipulate dependencies +
  with command line flags
* lead to IDE errors in projects +
  that directly depend on them

Work best for transitive dependencies.

=== Broken module descriptors

```java
// TODO
```

=== Reflective access

Reflection no longer "just works".

```bash
Exception in thread "main" InaccessibleObjectException:
	Unable to make ... accessible:
	module ... does not "opens ..." to module ...
```

=== Reflective access

Solution: ::
Open packages for reflection +
in module declaration.

Workaround: ::
Open packages for reflection +
at launch with `--add-opens`.

=== In module declaration

Analyze which parts of your code +
need to be reflected over, e.g.:

* Spring controllers
* JPA entities
* classes for JSON or XML

Open packages in module declaration:

```java
module com.example.app {
	opens com.example.app.controllers;
	opens com.example.app.json;
}
```

=== In module declaration

Consider only opening packages +
to the modules that reflect:

```java
module com.example.app {
	opens com.example.app.controllers
		to spring.beans, spring.core, spring.context;
	opens com.example.app.json
		 to com.fasterxml.jackson.databind;
}
```

* better security
* better documentation

=== At launch

For access to modules you don't create:

```bash
java --add-opens
	com.example.lib/com.example.lib.values=$MODULE
```

Where `$MODULE` is:

* the name of the reflecting module
* `ALL-UNNAMED` for reflection from class path

=== Guesswork

Dependencies may not report errors from reflection.

For quick experiments, open your modules:

```java
open module com.example.app {
	// no more `opens` directives
}
```

If error vanishes, it was an issue with reflection.

=== Unsupported media type

Projects that aren't prepared for modules:

* can have various run-time issues
* sometimes react poorly by +
  hiding the underlying cause

‚áù Search the log for module-related errors.

=== Searching the log

Search terms for module system errors:

* "module", "lang.module", "module path"
* "layer", "boot layer"
* "visible", "exported", "public", "illegal", "access"

Sometimes, projects just swallow errors. üòî

‚áù Take the module system out of the equation.

=== Suspending modules

> Everything* that works on the module path +
> also works on the class path.
>
> (* except services in `module-info.java`)

When debugging a weird error:

* create https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example[minimal reproducible example]
* launch on class path
* if error vanishes, debug harder

=== Healing the world

Two categories of problems in dependencies:

* they do something they shouldn't
* they don't tell you that +
  you need to do something

Such cases need to be fixed on their end!
