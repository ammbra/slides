=== Concise method bodies

[source,java]
----
class ListWrapper<E> implements List<E> {

    private List<E> list;

    public int size() -> list.size();
    public T get(int index) -> list.get(index);
	public int indexOf(E el) = list::indexOf;

}

*Yeah:*

* simple methods get simple code
* fewer (empty) lines

=== Death to serialization!

Serialization is hell:

* complicates every JDK feature
* repeated security vulnerabilities
* uses "invisible" mechanisms

The JDK team wants to get rid of it!

=== Serializing records

Replacement may look as follows:

* only works with records
* deconstructs a record graph
* passes data to serialization engine
* one engine per format: +
  XML, JSON, YAML, ...

=== New serialization

*Yeah:*

* records are a great fit for serialization
* new mechanism uses (de)constructors
* superior maintainability
