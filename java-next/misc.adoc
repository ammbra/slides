== Ad break

There's much more going on!

=== APIs

Lots of API additions and changes:

* sequenced collections ㉑ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/431[JEP 431])
* IP address resolution SPI ⑱ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/418[JEP 418])
* new random generator API ⑰ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/356[JEP 356])
* Unix domain sockets ⑯ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/380[JEP 380])

As well as lots of small additions to: +
  `String`, `Stream`, `Math`, `CompletableFuture`, regex, HTTP/2 API

=== Continuous improvements

Usability:

* UTF-8 by default ⑱ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/400[JEP 400])
* simple web server ⑱ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/408[JEP 408])
* helpful NPEs ⑭ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/358[JEP 358])

Tooling:

* JFR scrubbing ⑲ (https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8271585[JDK-8271585])
* code snippets in Javadoc ⑱ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/413[JEP 413])
* packaging tool ⑯ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/392[JEP 392])
* JFR event streaming ⑭ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/349[JEP 349])

=== Continuous improvements

Performance:

* auto-generated CDS ⑲ (https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8261455[JDK-8261455])
* dynamic CDS archives ⑬ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/350[JEP 350])
* default CDS archives ⑫ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/341[JEP 341])
* generational ZGC ㉑ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/439[JEP 439])

Continuous GC and performance improvements.

=== Continuous improvements

Security:

* key encapsulation mechanism API ㉑ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/452[JEP 452])
* context-specific deserialization filters ⑰ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/415[JEP 415])
* Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ⑮ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/339[JEP 339])
* ongoing enhancements (https://seanjmullan.org/blog/[Sean Mullan's blog])


=== Cleaning house

Deprecations (for removal):

* Windows 32-bit x86 port ㉑ (https://openjdk.org/jeps/449[JEP 449])
* finalization ⑱ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/421[JEP 421])
* security manager ⑰ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/411[JEP 411])
* applet API ⑰ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/398[JEP 398])
* primitive wrapper constructors ⑯ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/390[JEP 390])
* biased locking ⑮ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/374[JEP 374])

=== Cleaning house

Already removed:

* RMI activation ⑰ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/407[JEP 407])
* Nashorn ⑮ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/372[JEP 372])
* concurrent mark sweep GC ⑭ (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/363[JEP 363])

=== Migrations

To ease migrations:

* stick to supported APIs
* stick to standardized behavior
* stick to well-maintained projects
* keep dependencies and tools up to date
* stay ahead of removals (`jdeprscan`)
* build on each release (including EA)

Then you, too, can enjoy these projects ASAP!

=== Adoption

[%step]
* Java 11+ overtook Java 8
* adoption of 17 (from 11) looks good
* lots of excitement for Java 21
