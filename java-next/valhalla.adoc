* launched July 2014

=== Motivation

In Java, (almost) everything is a class:

* mutable by default
* memory access indirection
* requires extra memory for header
* allows locking and other +
identity-based operations

Wouldn't it be nice to create a custom `int`?

=== Value types

[source,java]
----
public value Range {

	// implicitly final
	private int low;
	private int high;

	// you write:
	//  * constructor, static factories
	//  * equals/hashCode/toString
	//  * accessors, etc.

}

public value Range {
	private int low;
	private int high;
}

*Yeah:*

* enforced immutability
* no memory indirection! (_flat_)
* no `Object` header! (_dense_)
* makes Java more expressive

=== Value types

> Codes like a class, works like an `int`.

The deal:

* give up identity / mutability +
(and self references)
* get flat and dense memory layout

=== Values vs Records

==== Values

no identity / mutability +
⇝ flat and dense memory layout

==== Records

no encapsulation +
⇝ less boilerplate

Might be combinable to "value records".

=== Generic specialization

When everybody creates their own "primitives", +
boxing becomes omni-present and very painful!

[source,java]
----
List<int> ids = new ArrayList<>();
----

*Yeah:*

* backed by an actual `int[]`
* great performance
* works with your value types

=== Put together

Value types and generic specialization together, +
have immense effects inside the JDK!

* no more manual specializations:
** functional interfaces
** stream API
** `Optional` API
* better performance

=== Put together

Value types and generic specialization together, +
have immense effects on your code!

* fewer trade-offs between +
design and performance
* better performance
* can express design more clearly
* more robust APIs

=== Project Valhalla

Makes Java more expressive and performant:

* value types
* primitive specialization
