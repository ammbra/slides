* launched July 2014
* led by Brian Goetz and John Rose

=== Motivation

Java has a split type system:

* primitives
* classes

We can only create classes, but:

* have identity
* have references

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* split caused by need for numerical performance
* got worse with generics
* got weird with (auto-)boxing
* got worse again with lambdas/streams
--

=== Identity

All classes come with _identity_:

* extra memory for header
* mutability
* locking, synchronization, etc.

But not all custom types need that!

=== References

All class instances come as _references_:

* memory access indirection
* nullability

But not all custom types need that!

=== Project Valhalla

Valhalla's goals is to unify the type system:

* _value types_ (disavow identity)
* something ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (disavow identity + references)
* _universal generics_ (`ArrayList<int>`)
* _specialized generics_ (backed by `int[]`)

=== Value types

[source,java]
----
value class RationalNumber {
	private long nominator;
	private long denominator;

	// constructor, etc.
}
----

Codes (almost) like a class - exceptions:

* class and fields are implcitly final
* superclasses are limited

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* can be records
* fields, methods, constructors
* use generics, implement interfaces
* nested classes, class literals
--

=== Value type behavior

No identity:

* some runtime operations throw exceptions
* "identity" check `==` compares by state
* `null` is default value

Benefits:

* guaranteed immutability
* more expressiveness
* more optimizations

=== Migration to value types

> The JDK (as well as other libraries) has many value-based classes, such as `Optional` and `LocalDateTime`. [...]
> We plan to migrate many value-based classes in the JDK to value classes.

=== Getting rid of references

Value types have references:

* allow `null`
* prevent flattening

How do we get rid of them?

=== Something ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Two proposals:

* primitive classes
* nullness markers

=== Primitive types

Proposed by https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/401[JEP 401]:

```java
primitive class ComplexNumber { /* ... */ }
```

Properties:

* no identity (like value types)
* no references:
** non-nullable
** default value has all fields set to their defaults

=== Primitive types

But:

* declaration-site
* requires a box, e.g. `ComplexNumber.ref`
* ad-hoc solution to larger problem

=== Nullness markers

Currently https://mail.openjdk.org/pipermail/valhalla-spec-experts/2023-February/002223.html[discussed on the mailing list]:

* use-site nullness markers (yes: `?`, `!`, etc.)
* value class + not null = flattenable

This is still very vague!

=== Either way...

* flattenable instances
* performance comparable +
  to today's primitives!

=== Universal generics

When everybody creates their own value classes, +
boxing becomes omni-present and very painful!

Universal generics allow value classes +
as type parameters:

[source,java]
----
List<long> ids = new ArrayList<>();
List<RationalNumber> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
----

=== Specialized generics

Healing the rift in the type system is great!

But if `ArrayList<int>` is backed by `Object[]`, +
it will still be avoided in many cases.

Specialized generics will fix that: +
Generics over primitives will avoid references!

=== Project Valhalla

Value types and _something_ plus +
universal and specialized generics:

* fewer trade-offs between +
  design and performance
* no more manual specializations
* better performance
* can express design more clearly
* more robust APIs

Makes Java more expressive and performant.
