http://jdk.java.net/valhalla/[early access builds]
* launched July 2014
* led by Brian Goetz and John Rose

=== Motivation

Java has a split type system:

* primitives
* classes

=== Primitives

Potential downsides:

* no class-building techniques
* no custom primitives
* can't use with generics

Forced move in 90s to allow for +
acceptable numeric performance.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* caused by need for numerical performance
* got worse with generics
* got weird with (auto-)boxing
* got worse again with lambdas/streams
--

=== Classes

Potential downsides:

* mutable by default
* memory access indirection
* extra memory for header
* allow locking and other +
identity-based operations

=== Root cause

All custom types come with _identity_:

* mutability
* layout polymorphism
* `equal` but `!=`
* synchronization
* etc.

All custom types come as _references_:

* nullability
* protect from tearing

But not all custom types need that!

=== Project Valhalla

Valhalla's goals is to unify the type system:

* _value types_ (disavow identity)
* _primitive types_ (disavow references), +
  which current primitives are instances of
* _universal generics_ (`ArrayList<int>`)
* _specialized generics_ (backed by `int[]`)

=== Value types

[source,java]
----
value class RationalNumber {
	private long nominator;
	private long denominator;

	// constructor, etc.
}
----

Codes (almost) like a class - exceptions:

* class and fields are implcitly final
* superclasses are limited

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* can be records
* fields, methods, constructors
* use generics, implement interfaces
* nested classes, class literals
--

=== Value type behavior

No identity:

* some runtime operations +
  (e.g. synchronization) +
  throw exceptions
* `==` compares by state

References:

* `null` is default value
* no tearing

=== Value type benefits

* guaranteed immutability
* more expressiveness
* more optimizations

=== Migration to value types

> The JDK (as well as other libraries) has many value-based classes, such as `Optional` and `LocalDateTime`. [...]
> We plan to migrate many value-based classes in the JDK to value classes.

=== Primitive types

```java
primitive class ComplexNumber {
	private long rational;
	private long irratoinal;

	// constructor, etc.
}
```

Codes (almost) like a value class - exception:

* no field of own type +
  (i.e. no circularity)

=== Primitive type behavior

No identity (like value types).

No references:

* default value has all fields set to their defaults
* can tear under concurrent assignment

Benefit:

* performance comparable to that of today's primitives!

=== Primitive "boxes"

Sometimes, even `int` needs to be a reference:

* nullability
* non-tearability
* self-reference

So we box to `Integer`.

What about `ComplexNumber`?

=== Primitive "boxes"

Each primitive class `P` declares two types:

* `P`: as discussed so far
* `P.ref`: behaves like a value type

```java
primitive class Node<T> {
    T value;
    Node.ref<T> nextNode;
}
```

=== Migration to primitive types

> [W]e want to adjust the basic primitives (`int`, `double`, etc.) to behave as consistently with new primitives as possible.

On the example of `int`/`Integer`:

* declare `int` as primitive class
* alias `Integer` with `int.ref`
* remove `Integer`

=== Universal generics

When everybody creates their own values and primitives, +
boxing becomes omni-present and very painful!

Universal generics allow value/primitive +
classes as type parameters:

[source,java]
----
List<long> ids = new ArrayList<>();
List<RationalNumber> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
----

=== Specialized generics

Healing the rift in the type system is great!

But if `ArrayList<int>` is backed by `Object[]`, +
it will still be avoided in many cases.

Specialized generics will fix that: +
Generics over primitives will avoid references!

=== Project Valhalla

Value and primitive types plus +
universal and specialized generics:

* fewer trade-offs between +
  design and performance
* no more manual specializations
* better performance
* can express design more clearly
* more robust APIs

Makes Java more expressive and performant.

=== Timeline

My personal (!) guesses (!!):

JDK 20 (2023)::
* value classes preview (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/8277163[JEP draft])
JDK 21 (2023)::
* primitive classes preview (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/401[JEP 401])
* primitives as classes preview (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/402[JEP 402])
* universal generics preview (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/8261529[JEP draft])
2025::
* specialized generics preview
