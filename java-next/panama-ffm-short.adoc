=== Foreign memory

Storing data off-heap is tough:

* `ByteBuffer` is limited (2GB) and inefficient
* `Unsafe` is... unsafe and not supported

=== Foreign-memory API

Safe and performant foreign-memory API:

* control (de)allocation: +
 `Arena`, `MemorySegment`, `SegmentAllocator`
* to access/manipulate: `MemoryLayout`, `VarHandle`

=== Foreign functions

JNI isn't ideal:

* involves several tedious artifacts (header file, impl, ...)
* can only interoperate with languages that align +
  with OS/architecture the JVM was built for
* doesn't reconcile Java/C type systems

=== Foreign-function API

Streamlined tooling/API for foreign functions +
based on method handles:

* `jextract`: generates method handles from header file
* classes to call foreign functions +
  `Linker`, `FunctionDescriptor`, `SymbolLookup`
