TODOs for 19 (for many, see newscasts #21 and #27)

Features:
* UTF-8 by default - https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/400
* jwebserver - https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/408
* Javadoc code snippets - https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/413
* Java 9 additions to `CompletableFuture`

Previews:
* add record patterns to pattern matching
* virtual threads and structured concurrency
* vector API (see Panama section in java-next)
* foreign APIs

Create tool section:
* jpackage (already there)
* simple web server
* JFR streaming?
* jshell?
////

== Let's get started!

* this talk covers Java 19 +
  and whatever else we have time for
* this is a showcase, not a tutorial
// * ask questions any time or tweet at https://twitter.com/nipafx[@nipafx]
// * tweet questions with https://twitter.com/search?q=%23jokerconf%20%23java11[#jokerconf #Java11]
// * some features come with practical exercises, +
//  others are just showcased
* slides at https://slides.nipafx.dev/java-x[slides.nipafx.dev/java-x] +
  (hit "?" to get navigation help)
* they cover Java 9 to 19+ +
  (without module system)

=== Lots to talk about!

=== Why upgrade?

Costs of running on old versions:

* support contract for Java
* waning support in libraries / frameworks

=== Why upgrade?

Costs of not running on new versions:

* lower productivity
* less observability and performance +
  (more on that later)
* worse access to talent
* bigger upgrade costs

=== Why upgrade?

> Resistence is futile.

=== How to upgrade?

Preparations:

* stick to supported APIs
* stick to standardized behavior
* stick to well-maintained projects
* keep dependencies and tools up to date
* stay ahead of removals (`jdeprscan`)
* build on each release (including EA)

=== How to upgrade?

If you're on...

* *Java 8*: upgrade ASAP to 11
* *Java 11*: prepare upgrade to 17
* *Java 17*: consider upgrading to 19

=== What about LTS?

Within OpenJDK, there is no LTS.

⇝ has no impact on features, reliability, etc.

It's a vendor-centric concept +
to offer continuous fixes +
(usually for money).

> You're paying not to get new features.
