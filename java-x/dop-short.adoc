=== Data-Oriented Programming

Use Java's strong typing to model data as data:

* use types to model data, particularly:
** data as data with records
** alternatives with sealed types
* use (static) methods to model behavior, particularly:
** exhaustive `switch` without `default`
** pattern matching to destructure polymorphic data

=== Data-Oriented Programmingâ€¦

â€¦ isn't funtional programming::
* but it's similar (data + functions)
* first priority is data, not functions

â€¦ doesn't kill object-oriented programming::
* use OOP to modularize large systems
* use DOP to model small, data-focused (sub)systems
