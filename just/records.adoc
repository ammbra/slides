=== What We Want

Being able to add fields to records:

[source,java]
----
record Customer(String name) {

	// no accessor
	private final String id;

	// [...]

}
----

=== Why Do We Want That?

To benefit from encapsulation _and_ +
boilerplate reduction?

The thing is: +
Records are about neither.

=== Record Semantics

Core semantics (https://openjdk.org/jeps/395[source]):

[quote]
____
[Records] are classes that act as transparent carriers for immutable data.
____

Transparency inspires this motto for records (https://cr.openjdk.org/~briangoetz/amber/datum.html[source]):

[quote]
____
The API for a record models the state, the whole state, and nothing but the state.
____

=== Restrictions

Transparency implies restrictions:

* an accessor for each component +
  (or the API doesn't model the state)
* an accessible constructor with +
  one parameter per component +
  (or the API doesn't model the state)
* **no additional fields** +
  (or the API doesn't model the whole state)
* no class inheritance +
  (or the API doesn't model the whole state)

=== Ok, But Why?

Records were designed to be _nominal tuples_:

* _nominal_ means they have names +
  (as all types in Java do)
* _tuples_ are a mathematical concept +
  (pairs, triples, etc. are tuples)

For a type to be a tuple, +
it must conform to the restrictions.

(https://nipafx.dev/java-record-semantics/#math-sorry[A bit more on the math.])

=== Ok, But Why?!

If records are tuples, +
their deconstruction becomes:

* easy
* lossless

⇝ We can do a few cool things!

=== Destructuring

https://openjdk.org/jeps/405[JEP 405] proposes _record patterns_ +
that deconstruct records:

[source,java]
----
if (range instanceof Range(int low, int high)
		&& high < low)
	return new Range(high, low);
----

Transparency ⇝ no hidden state was lost.

=== With Blocks

Future Java may (!) introduce `with` blocks:

[source,java]
----
Range range = new Range(5, 10);
// SYNTAX IS MADE UP!
Range newRange = range with {
	low = 0;
};
// range: [5; 10]
// newRange: [0; 10]
----

Transparency ⇝ no hidden state was lost.

=== Serialization

Transparency makes record (de)serialization:

* easier to implement and maintain in JDK
* easier to use and maintain in your code
* safer
* faster

(More in https://inside.java/2021/03/08/podcast-014/[Inside Java Podcast, episode 14].)

=== Summary

* records want to be (nominal) tuples
* that requires transparency
* transparency requires no additional fields
* transparency affords additional features +
  like destructuring, `with` blocks, better serialization

=== Higher-Level Summary

It makes sense to introduce someting that has restricions +
if those restrictions enable other features.
