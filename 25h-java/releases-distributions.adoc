== Releases, Licenses, Support
image::images/merry-go-round.jpg[background, size=cover]

// TODO: toc

// TODO: images in comments (also source)

// TODO: preview features, incubator modules, that new JEP about APIs for language features

=== The new world

* OpenJDK is the default +
(not Oracle JDK)
* major release every 6 months +
(not every 2-5 years)
* only selected versions get LTS +
(not all of them)


// OPEN JDK

=== What's OpenJDK?

OpenJDK is Java's reference implementation:

* a project
* a code base

It doesn't ship binaries, but others do:

* Oracle on https://jdk.java.net/[jdk.java.net]
* AdoptOpenJDK on https://adoptopenjdk.net/[adoptopenjdk.net]

=== OpenJDK vs Oracle JDK

Sun/Oracle JDK used to...

* contain more features
* be perceived as more stable
* be perceived as more performant

As of Java 11, on a technical basis, +
*Oracle JDK and OpenJDK are identical*.
https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/oracle-jdk-releases-for-java-11-and-later[*]

=== OpenJDK vs Oracle JDK

Only difference is license and support model:

* *Oracle's OpenJDK*: licensed under GPL+CE
* *Oracle JDK* is fully commercial: +
from 11 on, no free use in production

*‚áù OpenJDK is the new default!* +
*(https://medium.com/@javachampions/java-is-still-free-2-0-0-6b9aa8d6d244[Java is still free])*

(More on support later...)


// SIX-MONTH RELEASES

=== More releases?

The old plan:

* releases are driven by flagship features
* new major release roughly every 2 years

The old reality:

* Java 7 took 5 years
* Java 8 took 3 years
* Java 9 took 3.5 years

"Bump an 'almost ready' feature +
2+ years into the future?"

*‚áù "Better to delay the release."*

=== Downsides

* implemented features provide no value
* increases reaction time
* puts (political) pressure on projects
* makes everybody grumpy

=== More releases!

> If it hurts, do it more often.

* fixed six-month release cadence +
(March and September)
* ship everything that is ready

All are major releases +
with known quality guarantees.

‚áù No "beta versions"!

=== Upsides

* completed features get out earlier
* no pressure to complete features on time
* easier to react to changes in the ecosystem
* easier to incubate features

=== Incubate features?

Two concepts allow features to incubate:

* https://openjdk.org/jeps/11[incubator modules] for APIs
* https://blog.codefx.org/java/enable-preview-features/[preview language features]

Features are shipped for experimentation.

There are safeguards against accidental proliferation.

=== Release fatigue?

"Java will change too fast."

"Test matrix will explode."

"Ecosystem will fragment."

"Constant migrations will be expensive."

// "Nobody will leave Java 11 behind."

=== Fast Change

[quote,Mark Reinhold]
____
The rate of innovation doesn't change.
The rate of innovation delivery increases.

Maybe speed will pick up a little:

* recent activities target low-hanging fruits
* Oracle is focusing on Java core (my impression!)

=== Fast Change

By and large:

*Evolution will be _steadier_, not _faster_.*

(see Java 10+)

=== Exploding test matrix

As the range of supported versions increases...

* builds need to run against all of them
* developers need to switch between them

Many tools already support this. +
*‚áù We need to know how.*

Also: Moar automization!

=== Fragmenting Ecosystem

"This will be like Python 2/3!"

No.

=== Expensive migrations

Yes, https://blog.codefx.org/java/java-9-migration-guide[Java 9 migration is tough]!

But not the norm:

* Java 10 is trivial
* Java 11 is easy
* Java 12 is trivial
* ...

Oracle is still committed +
to backwards compatibility!

=== Expensive migrations

Balance shifted between +
*compatibility vs evolution*:

* `@Deprecated(forRemoval=true)`
* "one major release" is now 6 months, not 36
* increasing bytecode level
* incubating features (if used inappropriately!)

=== Expensive migrations

Remedies:

* stick to supported APIs
* stick to standardized behavior
* stick to well-maintained projects
* keep dependencies and tools up to date
// * consider using `jlink`

=== JLink can help

Use `jlink` to create application images:

* contain just the platform modules you need
* contain your code and your dependencies
* launch with `image/bin/your-app`

Single deployment unit, +
independent of installed JRE.

=== JLink considerations

Independent of installed JRE:

* no compatibility issues
* no automatic performance gain
* no automatic security updates

Works great if you have +
*complete control* +
over the deployment.

Not so much if you deliver software.

// LTS

=== What is LTS?

To discuss long-term support, +
lets look at JDK development:

* there's the OpenJDK code base at +
https://hg.openjdk.org/jdk/jdk/[hg.openjdk.org/jdk/jdk/]
* there are many clones:
** for each JDK release
** for each JDK project
** each vendor has their own

=== OpenJDK development

*A new feature, simplified:*

* developed in "feature branch"
* merged into "master" when (nearly) finished

*A release, simplified:*

* "release branch" created 3 months prior
* only bug fixes merged to "release branch"

*A bug/security/etc fix, simplified:*

* usually developed in "master"
* merged into relevant release branches

=== OpenJDK support

Support really means:

* fixing bugs, usually in "master"
* merging fixes to "release branches"

How does *Oracle* handle that?

* work on "master" in *OpenJDK*
* merge to *current* "release branch" in *OpenJDK*
* merge to *LTS* version in *Oracle JDK*

=== Long-term support

What's left for long-term support?

‚áù *Merging fixes into old JDK versions.*

=== Commercial LTS

* https://www.oracle.com/java/java-se-subscription.html[Oracle]
* https://developer.ibm.com/javasdk/support/lifecycle/[IBM] /
https://access.redhat.com/articles/1299013[RedHat]
* https://www.azul.com/products/azul_support_roadmap/[Azul]
* ...

=== Free LTS

Long-term support for *OpenJDK*:

* commitment by the community: +
4+ years for 8, 11, 17, 23, etc.
* https://access.redhat.com/articles/1299013[under Red Hat's guidance]:
** for OpenJDK 8 until 06/2023
** for OpenJDK 11 until 10/2024
* built and shipped by https://adoptopenjdk.net/[Adopt OpenJDK]

=== Free LTS

Other players:

* https://sap.github.io/SapMachine/[SapMachine]
* https://github.com/alibaba/dragonwell8[Alibaba Dragonwell8]
* https://bell-sw.com/pages/java-12.0.2/[Liberica JDK]

More?

////
=== Free LTS

Amazon Corretto:

* builds on OpenJDK
* contains additional security +
and stability fixes by Amazon

It is https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/faqs[updated quarterly]:

* Java 8 until at least 06/2023
* Java 11 until at least 08/2024
////

=== Staying on Java 11 LTS

I'd love for everyone +
to always be up to date.

*But:*

Going from Java 11 to 12 +
is not without risks.

üò¢

=== Risks for Java 12-16

Lack of support for 12-16:

* free support is very unlikely
* commercial support is rare +
(Azul https://www.azul.com/products/azul_support_roadmap/[offers] MTS for 13 and 15)

Without support, you have to upgrade +
to *each major version* immediately!

=== Risks for Java 12-16

What could possibly go wrong?!

Before you upgrade to Java 12:

[%step]
. read https://blog.joda.org/2018/10/adopt-java-12-or-stick-on-11.html[_Should you adopt Java 12 [...\]?_] +
by Stephen Colebourne
. take a coffee break
. understand that most risks come +
from *building against* 12
. be content that all you need +
to upgrade is *run on* 12

=== Risks for Java 12-16

What could possibly go wrong?!

* `@Deprecated(forRemoval=true)`
* changes to unsupported APIs, e.g. `Unsafe`

Problems are not likely, +
but usually hard to predict.

‚áù *Chance is low.*

=== Risks for Java 12-16

If an upgrade fails, +
you have two choices:

* run on an unsupported (*unsecure*) JVM üòÆ
* *downgrade* to recent LTS üò±

‚áù *Damage is potentially enormous.*

=== Risks for Java 12-16

[source]
----
expected_damage = chance * damage
----

Consider this:

* more up-to-date ‚áù lower chance
* fewer dependencies ‚áù lower chance
* smaller code base ‚áù smaller damage

=== Advice

* find a suitable upgrade cadence
* *build on each release* (including EA)
* only rely on standardized behavior
* heed deprecation warnings (`jdeprscan`)
* keep dependencies and tools up to date

Most importantly: +
*Be aware of what's coming!*
