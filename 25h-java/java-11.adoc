=== Migration

I recently did a stream on that: +
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/614048355[twitch.tv/videos/614048355]

*TL;DR:*

Replace Java EE modules +
with regular dependencies

=== String

=== Strip White Space

Getting rid of white space:

```java
String strip();
String stripLeading();
String stripTrailing();
```

Only at beginning and end of string:

```java
" foo bar ".strip().equals("foo bar");
```

=== What About Trim?

Wait, what about `trim()`?

* `trim()` defines white space as:
+
____
any character whose codepoint +
is less than or equal to `'U+0020'` +
(the space character)
____
* `strip()` relies on `Character::isWhitespace`, +
  which covers many more cases

=== Is Blank?

Is a string only white space?

```java
boolean isBlank();
```

Functionally equivalent to:

```java
string.isBlank() == string.strip().isEmpty();
```

=== Life Hack

As soon as Java APIs get new method, +
scour StackOverflow for easy karma!

=== Streaming Lines

Processing a string's lines:

```java
Stream<String> lines();
```

* splits a string on `"\n"`, `"\r"`, `"\r\n"`
* lines do not include terminator
* more performant than `split("\R")`
* lazy!


=== Even More New&nbsp;Methods

```java
Optional.isEmpty();

Path.of(String); // ~ Paths.get(String)

Files.readString(Path);
Files.writeString(Path, CharSequence, ...);

Reader.nullReader();
Writer.nullWriter();
InputStream.nullInputStream();
OutputStream.nullOutputStream();

DateTimeFormatter.localizedBy(Locale locale);
```


=== Launch Source File

Faster feedback with fewer tools.

=== Launching A Single Source File

Compiling and running +
simple Java programs is verbose.

Not any more!

```
java HelloJava11.java
```

=== Background

How it works:

* compiles source into memory
* runs from there

Details:

* requires module _jdk.compiler_
* processes options like class/module path et al.
* interprets `@files` for easier option management

=== Use Cases

Mostly similar to `jshell`:

* easier demonstrations
* more portable examples
* experimentation with new language features +
  (combine with `--enable-preview`)

*But also: script files!*

=== Scripts

Steps towards easier scripting:

* arbitrary file names
* shebang support

=== Arbitrary File Names

Use `--source` if file doesn't end in `.java`:

```
java --source 11 hello-java-11
```

=== Shebang Support

To create "proper scripts":

* include shebang in source:
+
```sh
#!/opt/jdk-11/bin/java --source 11
```
* name script and make it executable
* execute it as any other script:
+
```sh
# from current directory:
./hello-java-11
# from PATH:
hello-java-11
```


=== Even More New&nbsp;JVM&nbsp;Features

* Unicode 9 & 10 (https://openjdk.org/jeps/327[JEP 327])
* Curve25519 and Curve448 (https://openjdk.org/jeps/324[JEP 324])
* ChaCha20 and Poly1305 (https://openjdk.org/jeps/329[JEP 329])
* partial TLS 1.3 support (https://openjdk.org/jeps/332[JEP 332])


=== Even More Performance

* Epsilon GC (https://openjdk.org/jeps/318[JEP 318])
* ZGC (experimental, https://openjdk.org/jeps/333[JEP 333])
* low-overhead heap profiling (https://openjdk.org/jeps/331[JEP 331])
* open-source Flight Recorder (https://openjdk.org/jeps/328[JEP 328])
