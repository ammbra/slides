=== Failing tests

Why do tests fail?

. something broke for good ⇝ fix it
. something broke temporarily ⇝ `@Disabled`
. something fails under certain circumstances +
⇝ conditionally `@Disabled`

We'll talk about the latter.

=== Conditional tests

JUnit 5 comes with lots of conditions +
based on:

* operating system
* Java version
* system properties
* environment variables
* scripts

=== Conditional tests

They all come in two forms:

* `@Enabled...`
* `@Disabled...`

Just slap them on the test method:

```java
@Test
@EnabledOnOs(OS.LINUX)
void runsOnLinux() { /*...*/ }
```

=== OS conditions

Based on operating system +
(`LINUX`, `WINDOWS`, `MAC`, ...):

```java
@EnabledOnOs(LINUX)
@EnabledOnOs({ WINDOWS, MAC })
@DisabledOnOs(LINUX)
@DisabledOnOs({ WINDOWS, MAC })
```

=== Java version condition

Based on Java version +
(`JAVA_8`, `JAVA_9`, `JAVA_10`, ...):

```java
@EnabledOnJre(JAVA_8)
@EnabledOnJre({ JAVA_9, JAVA_10 })
@DisabledOnJre(JAVA_8)
@DisabledOnJre({ JAVA_9, JAVA_10 })
```

=== Environment

Based on system properties or environment variables +
(matched by regular expression):

```java
@EnabledIfSystemProperty(
	named = "os.arch", matches = ".*64.*")
@DisabledIfSystemProperty(
	named = "ci-server", matches = "true")

@EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable(
	named = "ENV", matches = "staging-server")
@DisabledIfEnvironmentVariable(
	named = "ENV", matches = ".*development.*")
```

=== Scripted conditions

`@EnabledIf`/`@DisabledIf` accept JS scripts:

```java
@Test
@EnabledIf({
	"load('nashorn:mozilla_compat.js')",
	"importPackage(java.time)",
	"var today = LocalDate.now()",
	"var tomorrow = today.plusDays(1)",
	"tomorrow.isAfter(today)" })
void theDayAfterTomorrow() { /*...*/ }
```

=== Scripted conditions

Uses Nashorn, but https://openjdk.org/jeps/335[Nashorn is deprecated]!

Other Java Scripting API engines can be specified:

```java
@Test
@EnabledIf(
	value = /*...*/,
	engine = /*...*/ )
void theDayAfterTomorrow() { /*...*/ }
```

=== Combining conditions

These conditions can be combined:

* only one condition from each group +
(OS, version, sys prop, env var, script)
* if one disables, test is disabled

On Linux and Java 10, does this test run?

```java
@Test
@EnabledOnOs(OS.LINUX)
@DisabledOnJre(JRE.JAVA_10)
void moreConditions() { /*...*/ }
```

=== Disabling conditions

To check which disabled tests actually fail:

* link:#configuring_junit[configure JUnit] with +
`junit.jupiter.conditions.deactivate`
* use property to define reg ex for class name
* matching condition classes are not evaluated

=== Disabling conditions

Example:

```
junit.jupiter.conditions.deactivate=*
```

Deactivates all conditions. +
⇝ All tests are executed.

=== Disabling tests
==== Summary

Conditional test execution:

* annotate tests with annotations +
`@Enabled...` or `@Disabled...`
* pick from various conditions +
(OS, version, sys prop, env var)
* combine them if necessary
* in extreme cases, write a script
* disable by configuration
