== Lots to talk about

The plan for today:

// * start with a *Java 8* code base
* start with a *Java 11* code base
* take it all the way to *Java 19* +
  (and beyond)
* be amazed by how much changes

This talk is:

* a showcase, not a tutorial
* not a complete list
* created with the lavish help +
  of the people in https://twitch.tv/nipafx[Twitch] chat

=== Links

* slides at https://slides.nipafx.dev/[slides.nipafx.dev]
* code at https://github.com/nipafx[github.com/nipafx]
** demo code base: https://github.com/nipafx/java-after-eight[/java-after-eight]
** more Java 9+ features: https://github.com/nipafx/demo-java-x[/demo-java-x]

// Tweet questions with https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaNext?src=hash[#JavaNext].
// I'll answer‚Äîlive!

== Java 8

* released 03/2014
* free support by Oracle *ended 01/2019*
* free support by Red Hat *until 06/2023*
* more free and commercial support available

=== It's a great release...

* solid feature set
* good performance
* very stable
* occasional backports
* great support

=== ...but it's getting dated

Java 8 misses out on most recent developments:

* many new language features
* many new and improved APIs
* many new JVM features
* improved performance +
  (in certain cases)

=== Time to upgrade

Let me show you how much +
you're missing out on +
if you're still on Java 8.

////

== Java 11

* released 09/2018
* free support by Oracle *ended 01/2019*
* free community support *until 10/2024*
* more free and commercial support available

=== It's a great release...

* first "modern" Java release with LTS
* solid feature set
* stable
* great support

=== ...but better things are waiting

Java 11 misses out on many recent developments:

* thrilling new language features
* some improved APIs
* a few new JVM features
* improved performance

=== Curious?

Let me show you how much +
you're missing out on +
if you're (still?) on Java 11.
