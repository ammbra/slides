== From Idea to IDE

// UPDATE TO TODAY
=== Some Ongoing Explorations

* "withers" for records
  (https://github.com/openjdk/amber-docs/blob/master/eg-drafts/reconstruction-records-and-classes.md[design notes])
* a relaxed launch protocoll
  (https://openjdk.org/projects/amber/design-notes/on-ramp[design notes])
* statements before `this`/`super` in constructors +
  (https://mail.openjdk.org/pipermail/amber-dev/2022-October/007537.html[some of the mails], https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8194743[issue])

=== Artifacts

* https://mail.openjdk.org/mailman/listinfo[mailing list] exchanges
* meetings
* design notes (e.g. https://openjdk.org/projects/amber/#documents[for Amber])
* https://github.com/openjdk/[prototypes]
* conference talks
* https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8301904?jql=project%20%3D%20JDK%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Open[JBS issues]

(Roughly in order.)

=== Unspecified

Unlike the steps so far, this one is:

* mostly unspecified
* mostly unstructured
* without barrier for contribution

=== Goals

* assess feasibility
* shape a general idea +
  to a specific proposal
* estimate complexity and effort

=== Considerations

* "Does it fit into Java / the ecosystem?"
* "Can it be implemented?"
* "Can it be introduced?"
* "What priority does it have?"

=== Evolution

During exploration, features evolve +
fundamentally and many are dropped.

My guesstimates:

* duration: 6-60 months
* rate of change: 50-500%
* rate of progression: 25-75%
