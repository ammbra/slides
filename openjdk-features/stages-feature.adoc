=== Text Blocks

> A text block is a multi-line string literal that avoids the need for most escape sequences, automatically formats the string in a predictable way, and gives the developer control over the format when desired.

* language feature added in Java 15
* triggered additions to `String`: +
  `formatted`,
  `indent`,
  `stripIndent`,
  `translateEscapes`

// === Artifacts
// image::images/jls-15-text-blocks+github-jdk.png[background, size=cover]

// * JLS, JVMS, Javadoc, etc. (specification)
// * openjdk/jdk (implementation)

=== Hallmarks

Java features:

* come as syntax, VM capabilities, APIs +
  (or any combination)
* specified in JLS, JVMS, Javadoc, etc. & +
  implemented in openjdk/jdk
* fulfill clearly defined requirements
* fit in seamlessly & have good tool support

> Why did _this_ take so long?

=== Evolution

Considerations for feature evolution/removal:

* Does it hurt?
* Is it used?
* Can it be extended/improved?
* Would a change/removal hurt?

=== Some Removals

Single underscore as variable name ⛔⑨: ::
* rarely used
* prevents very useful language feature
* easy to fix
Applet API ⚠️⑰: ::
* unused and unusable
Concurrent mark sweep GC ⛔⑭: ::
* maintenance cost
* lots of alternative GCs
* easy to fix

// Security manager::
// * very low adoption
// * easy to get wrong
// * maintenance cost
// * better mechansisms exist

// Primitive wrapper constructors::
// * prevent primitive types
// * easy to fix

// Finalization::
// * easy to get wrong
// * peformance & maintenance cost
// * better mechansisms exist

=== Evolution

Features are extremely stable +
but not immutable.

My guesstimates:

* rate of change: 1%
* survival rate: 99.9%

=== Evolution

But how does a feature become permanent?

Long story:

[%step]
* starts with an idea
* refinement in explorations
* prototype and proposal
* preview feature
* finalized feature
