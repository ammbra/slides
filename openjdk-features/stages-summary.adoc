== The Full Journey

Got everything?

[%step]

Let's rewind.

=== The Full Journey

[cols="2s, 8d", options="header"]
|===
|
|Considerations

|Idea
|"Can it be good for Java?"

|Exploration
|"How can it be implemented/introduced?"

|Proposal
|"Is this the best way to implement it?"

|Preview
|"Is it surfaced correctly?"

|Feature
|"Does it hurt? Can it be changed/removed?"
|===

=== Contributing Don'ts

* start with an implementation
* write a JEP or file a feature issue
* propose (just) a solution on a mailing list
* assume to be the first one with that idea
* forget to research past phases

=== Contributing Dos

* be mindful of the phase
* start with experimentation and reporting
* describe problems and solicit input
* discuss before coding

=== Nota Bene

Incubating APIs:

* belong into _Proposal_ (not _Preview_)
* come with alpha implementations

JEPs:

* not all proposals need one
* smaller changes rely on JBS issues

=== Why So Serious?

Every change impacts:

* millions of developers
* billions of lines of code
* research, games, hobby projects, +
  and billions of Euros of annual revenue

Better safe than sorry.
