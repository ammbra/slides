=== Artifacts

Proposals are defined by JEPs.

Often also come with implementations in +
project forks or feature branches of openjdk/jdk, e.g.:

* https://github.com/openjdk/valhalla[openjdk/valhalla]
* https://github.com/openjdk/amber/tree/super-init[openjdk/amber ðŸŒ³ super-init]

=== Goals & Considerations

Goals of JEPs:

* expose proposal to wider audience
* seek feedback on the proposed solution
* motivate, describe, archive proposals +
  with their contexts and consequences

Proposal considerations:

* "Is this the right way to do it?"

=== Evolution

Proposals evolve noticeably +
(particularly until _Candidate_) +
and most are delivered.

My guesstimates:

* duration: 6-36 months
* rate of change: 40%
* rate of progression: 85%
