=== Existing Ideas

Even Brian Goetz has so many, +
he needs a bunch of notebooks +

=== Free For All

Ideas are cheap... +

* no specifications
* no process
* no barriers
* no attention

...execution is everything.

Goal is to make Java / the JVM better.

Considerations:

* "Is this a good idea?"
* "... for Java?"
* "... now and/or in the future?"

=== Evolution

My guesstimates:

* duration: 🤷🏾‍♂️
* rate of change: 🤷🏾‍♂️
* rate of progression: 🤷🏾‍♂️
