== Resolution

When should you use this?

=== Domain Overload

Should you add `evaluate` this way? +
Probably not.

But what about:

* `Resources estimateResourceUsage()`
* `Strategy createComputationStrategy()`
* `Invoice createInvoice(User u)`
* `String prettyPrint()` (like https://github.com/Thihup/joel/commit/b49c9e7636ce409f9f875c4652fcaa905022dd62#diff-6a9248b7be98141e7c76af3955e11eb074d9cd88211aaf4be0d85c1453cc7649[here])
* `void draw(Direction d, Style s, Canvas c)`

⇝ Central abstractions can be overburdened +
with diverse requirements.

=== Visitor Pattern

Separating a hierarchy from operations +
is a case for https://nipafx.dev/java-visitor-pattern-pointless/[the visitor pattern].

Using pattern matching over sealed type:

* will often achieve same results
* leads to much simpler code

=== Edge of Space

When parsing outside data, +
types are often general +
(think `JsonNode`).

Consider pattern matching +
to tease apart the data.

=== Conclusion

* polymorphism remains default approach +
  to adding operations to types
* where that's not ideal or where types are general +
  consider pattern matching (and sealed classes)
* together, they make it **easy** and **safe** +
  to branch based on type and other properties
