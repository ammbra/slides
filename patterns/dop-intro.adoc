=== Programming Paradigms

Paradigms often come with an +
"Everything is a ..." sentence.

> The goal of any programming paradigm is to manage complexity.

* complexity comes in many forms
* not all paradigms handle all forms equally well

⇝ "It depends"

=== Object-Oriented Programming

> Everything is an object

* combines state and behavior
* hinges on encapsulation
* polymorphism through inheritance

Works best when defining/upholding boundaries.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* maintenance boundaries
* versioning boundaries
* encapsulation boundaries
* compilation boundaries
* compatibility boundaries
* security boundaries

=== Mixed Programming

Great use cases for OOP:

* boundaries between libraries and clients
* in large programs to enable modular reasoning

Consider a data-oriented approach for:

* smaller (sub)systems
* focused on data

=== Data-Oriented Programming

Guiding principles:

* model the data, the whole data, +
  and nothing but the data
* data is immutable
* validate at the boundary
* make illegal states unrepresentable
