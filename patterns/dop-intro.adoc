=== Programming Paradigms

Paradigms often come with an +
"Everything is a ..." sentence.

> The goal of any programming paradigm is to manage complexity.

* complexity comes in many forms
* not all paradigms handle all forms equally well

⇝ "It depends"

=== Object-Oriented Programming

> Everything is an object

* combines state and behavior
* works best when defining/upholding boundaries

Great use cases:

* boundaries between libraries and clients
* in large programs to enable modular reasoning

Smaller programs/subsystems have less need for boundaries.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* maintenance boundaries
* versioning boundaries
* encapsulation boundaries
* compilation boundaries
* compatibility boundaries
* security boundaries

=== Data-Oriented Programming

Use Java's strong typing to model data as data:

* use classes to represent data, particularly:
** data as data with records
** alternatives with sealed classes
* use methods (separately) to model behavior, particularly:
** exhaustive `switch` without `default`
** pattern matching to destructure polymorphic data

=== Guiding Principles

* model the data, the whole data, +
  and nothing but the data
* data is immutable
* validate at the boundary
* make illegal states unrepresentable
