Up to Java 21:

* `var`
* text blocks

Not on the test:

* sealed types
* pattern matching in switch
* unnamed patterns (preview)
* `with` expression (idea)

=== Project Amber

Amber is doing all that +
*AND MORE*:

* relaxed `this()`/`super()` (https://openjdk.org/jeps/447[JEP 447])
* primitive types in patterns (https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8288476[JEP draft])
* concise method bodies (https://openjdk.org/jeps/8209434[JEP draft])
* serialization revamp (https://openjdk.org/projects/amber/design-notes/towards-better-serialization[design notes])
