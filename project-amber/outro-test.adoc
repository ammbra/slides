*AND MORE*:

* primitive types in patterns (https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8288476[JEP draft])
* relaxed `this()`/`super()` (https://openjdk.org/jeps/8300786[JEP draft])
* concise method bodies (https://openjdk.org/jeps/8209434[JEP draft])
* serialization revamp (https://openjdk.org/projects/amber/design-notes/towards-better-serialization[design notes])
