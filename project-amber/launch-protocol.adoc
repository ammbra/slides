== Starting (With) Java

How Project Amber +
*paves the on-ramp* +
for new (Java) developers.

=== Why Do We Care?

We all know Java, IDEs, build tools, etc.

* do we all?
* what about your kids?
* what about students?
* what about the frontend dev?
* what about ML/AI folks?

Java needs to be approachable! +
Java needs an on-ramp for new (Java) developers!

=== Running Java

To write and run a simple Java program, you need:

[%step]
* a JDK
* an editor (IDE?)
* `javac` (build tool? IDE?)
* `java` (IDE?)
* some Java code

=== Writing Java

Minimal Java code:

```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, World!")
	}
}
```

[%step]
* visibility
* classes & methods
* static vs instance
* returns & parameters
* statements & arguments

=== Approachability

That's _a lot_ of tools and concepts!

Java is great for large-scale development:

* detailed toolchain
* refined programming model

This make it less approachable.

Let's change that!

=== jshell

Java 9 added `jshell`:

* *all you need*:
** tools: JDK, `jshell`
** concepts: statements & arguments
* *but*:
** not great for beginners (IMO)
** no progression

More is needed.

=== Single-file Execution

Java 11 added single-file execution:

```
java Prog.java
```

* **removed**: `javac`
* **but**: no progression

Much better for beginners, +
but just a section of an on-ramp.

=== On-Ramp

Expand single-file execution in two directions:

* *simplyify code*: reduce required Java concepts
* *ease progression*: run multiple files with `java`

=== Simpler Code

Remove requirement of:

* `String[] args` parameter
* `main` being static
* `main` or the class being public
* the class itself

```java
// all the code in Prog.java
void main() {
	System.out.println("Hello, World!")
}
```

=== Running Multiple Files

Say you have a folder:

```
MyFirstJava
 ├─ Prog.java
 ├─ Helper.java
 └─ Lib
     └─ library.jar
```

Run with:

```
java -cp 'Lib/*' Prog.java
```

=== Progression

Natural progression:

[%step]
* start with `main()`
* need arguments? ⇝ add `String[] args`
* need to organize code? ⇝ add methods
* need shared state? ⇝ add fields
* need more functionality? ⇝ explore JDK APIs
* even more? ⇝ explore simple libraries
* need more structure? ⇝ split into multiple files
* even more ⇝ use visibility & packages

=== Summary

Java's strengths for large-scale development +
make it less approachable:

* detailed toolchain
* refined programming model

Project Amber introduces new features that:

* make it easier to start
* allow gradual progression
* entice the future dev generation
