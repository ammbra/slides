== Java's Got Problems

[%step]
* slow
* old
* verbose
* cumbersome
* no fun!

[%step]
None of that is true.

[%step]
But none of it is (entirely) false, either.

=== Java's Got Problems

A more nuanced view +
(on some issues):

* strings lack expressiveness
* the type system and encapsulation +
  can get in the way
* dealing with data is clunky
* getting started isn't easy

=== The SolutionFactory

Project Amber:

> Right-sizing ceremony.

(Things that are important but cumbersome +
should be made less cumbersome.)

* launched March 2017
* led by Brian Goetz and Gavin Bierman

=== Project Amber

Goal is not:

* code golf
* feature overload

=== Project Amber

Instead, identify situations where:

* Java lacks expressiveness
* strengths turn into weaknesses
* tensions and tradeoffs occur

And resolve those for greater good!

=== Nota Bene

Amber is not the only project doing that!

* Valhalla -- _design vs performance_
* Loom -- _simplicity vs scalability_
* Panama -- _flexibility vs safety_
* Leyden -- _optimization vs specification_

=== Table of Contents

Getting back to Project Amber:

* strings
* type safety & encapsulation
* dealing with data
* starting (with) Java

(Pay attention, this will be on the test!)
