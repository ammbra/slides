[%step]
* slow
* old
* verbose

* no fun!

None of that is true, but +
none of it is (entirely) false.

=== Java's Got Problems

A more nuanced view +
(on some issues):

* strings lack expressiveness
* the type system and encapsulation +
  can get in the way
* dealing with data is clunky
* getting started isn't easy

* launched March 2017
* led by Brian Goetz, +
  and Gavin Bierman

=== Project Amber

Goal is not:

* syntax sugar
* minor improvements

Instead, identify situations where:

* Java lacks expressiveness
* strengths turn into weaknesses
* tensions and tradeoffs occur

And resolve those for greater good!

=== Nota Bene

Project Amber is not the only one doing that!

* Valhalla resolves _design vs performance_
* Loom resolves _simplicity vs scalability_
* Panama resolves _flexibility vs safety_
* Leyden resolves _optimization vs specification_

Getting back to Project Amber:

* strings
* type safety & encapsulation
* dealing with data
* starting (with) Java
